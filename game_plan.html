<h1>Game Development Conversation Summary</h1>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Game Concept:</strong> You are developing a text-based adventure game in Unity using C#. The game will use the ChatGPT AI for dynamic conversations with NPCs. The main goal of the game is for the player to discover their character's backstory.</li>
  <li><strong>Game World:</strong> The game is set in the city of Estel, the last known bastion of civilization in a world lost to chaos. The city is described in detail, including its geography, population, and key locations such as The Last Quarter Tavern, the Little Whispers Orphanage, the Playful Pussy Cat House, and the Harbour.</li>
  <li><strong>Characters:</strong> We have created detailed descriptions for several characters, including their roles, personalities, and secrets. These characters include Bartholomeus, Grimobak, Ninihrah, Tiberius, Baron Franklin Fascetti, Sheriff Em Shuzig, Fleet Master Palbo Senzuri, Francis Senzuri, Harbour Master Carg Kam, Corbin Sordelle, Sergeant Sodgaf Dask, and several commoners.</li>
  <li><strong>Game Design Document (GDD):</strong> We have started creating a GDD to detail the game world, characters, mechanics, and story. The GDD is being hosted on GitHub.</li>
  <li><strong>Player Creation:</strong> We discussed the idea of a story-driven player creation process, with the player's backstory being revealed gradually throughout the game.</li>
  <li><strong>Save and Load System:</strong> We discussed the need for a save and load system, with the idea that players can only save in certain locations.</li>
  <li><strong>Integration with ChatGPT:</strong> We discussed how to integrate the game with the ChatGPT API, including how to manage conversations and exchange data between the game and the AI.</li>
  <li><strong>Use of Links for Context:</strong> We explored the idea of using links to external documents to provide context to the AI, to save on tokens and keep the AI calls relevant to the game world and lore. We encountered some limitations with this approach, as the AI cannot directly access the content of documents hosted on Dropbox or Google Docs. We found a workaround by hosting the documents as HTML files on GitHub.</li>
  <li><strong>Long-term Memory Problem:</strong> We discussed the limitations of the AI's memory and how to work around them, such as by providing a summary of previous interactions at the start of each API call.</li>
  <li><strong>Next Steps:</strong> We discussed the next steps in the game development process, including further fleshing out the GDD, creating more characters, and designing the player creation mechanics and combat system.</li>
