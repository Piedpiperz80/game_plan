# Game Design Document for Text-Based Adventure Game

### Game World - Erda

Erda is a world lost to time, where nightmares stalk the shadows and leviathan lurk the depths. Magic permeates all, breathing life to the living and undying alike. The light of civilization perilously flickers as the forces of chaos rage around it. Humans, elves and half-orcs form uneasy alliances, struggling together for survival against the inevitable end. The dwarves fall far from memory long since fleeing to the mountain strongholds of old. The gods seem to have abandoned the world to the ever-growing forces of darkness. Yet there is hope. In the ruins of ancient civilizations, the last of the great magicians still cling to life. In the frozen north, the last of the dwarves still hold their ancestral strongholds. And in the dark places of the world, the last of the heroes still stand against the tide of darkness. It is a time of heroes. A time of magic. A time of legend.

### Estel

Estel is the last known bastion of civilization in Erda, holding fast against the forces that threaten it. The city is nestled in the mountains, with stone walls carved into and out of the mountains themselves. The cobblestone roads are perennially covered in cold sea spray, and the salt of the ocean is thick in the air. The sound of breaking waves is constant, as ever-present as the threats outside the walls.

The mountains offer natural protection to the South East, while the sea surrounds the city's Northern and Western borders. A nearly ruined bridge crossing offers a choke point to the main walled entrance over the river to its East. A great drawbridge denies all passage into and out of the city.

Much of the city lies derelict, with a population of approximately one thousand citizens. In another age, Estel must have been a great city, but that has fallen far from memory.

The city is comprised predominantly of Human, Elf, and Half-Elves, with Halfling and Half-Orc citizens making up the minority.

## Leadership

The Baron Franklin Fascetti rules Estel. Under his rule is the Captain of the fleet and the Sergeant at the wall. The Sheriff is responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating over mercantile matters.

The Fascetti family live in the keep of the inner city. Wealthier, more influential folk live outside the keep in the inner city.

## Locations

- Temple to Palor: A cleric offers his services at this temple.
- The Harbour: The harbour sells the bounty of the sea and is run by the harbour master.

The orphanage was established by the Sezuri family decades ago, Francis Sezuri continues the tradition today as the primary benefactor. The elderly who can no longer serve look after the children and during harvest times they all help in the fields.
- Playful Pussy Cat House: The oldest trade in town. The playful pussy provides a somewhat safe location for the women of the night to ply their trade. One of the few locations in the old town that the upper town folk care to frequent.
- The Harbour: A large bronze bell hangs over the docks of the harbour. A ready signal for any marauding orc parties. The smell of fish permeates the air. Large stalls of fish and other unidentifiable sea bounty sits upon tables with tents above. Large air drying racks bend under the strain of the salted fish it holds.
- The Church of Estel: The Church of Estel is a large, stone building with a towering steeple. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city, with weathered stone walls and stained glass windows that cast colorful patterns on the floor. Inside, the church is quiet and serene, with rows of wooden pews and a large altar at the front. Despite the harsh conditions outside, the church remains a place of peace and solace for the people of Estel.

## Mechanics

**Combat System:** The game will feature a 2-d graphic combat system. The player will control two icons at the same time. One will be an icon that is trying not to be hit by the enemy the other is an icon that they are trying to hit the enemy with. One will be controlled with WASD and Left Shift, the other will be controlled with LP;' and right shift. The shift key will be used to speed the icon up but will use and deplete stamina. How hard you hit and move etc. will be governed by skills and abilities. Armour will also play a factor. The size of the icon could be determined by your agility for example or what part of the body you are trying to hit.

**Conversation System:** The game will feature dynamic conversations with NPCs, powered by the ChatGPT AI. The player will be able to ask questions, respond to NPC dialogue, and make choices that can affect the story and their relationships with the characters.

**Time System:** The game will feature a time system that allows for pausing, real-time passing, and speeding up of time. The game world will have a unique calendar system that fits the lore of the world.
