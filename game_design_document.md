## Game World

### Estel

Estel is the last known bastion of civilization, holding fast against the forces that threaten it. The city is nestled in the mountains, with stone walls carved into and out of the mountains themselves. The cobblestone roads are perennially covered in cold sea spray, and the salt of the ocean is thick in the air. The sound of breaking waves is constant, as ever-present as the threats outside the walls.

The mountains offer natural protection to the South East, while the sea surrounds the city's Northern and Western borders. A nearly ruined bridge crossing offers a choke point to the main walled entrance over the river to its East. A great drawbridge denies all passage into and out of the city.

Much of the city lies derelict, with a population of approximately one thousand citizens. In another age, Estel must have been a great city, but that has fallen far from memory.

The city is comprised predominantly of Human, Elf, and Half-Elves, with Halfling and Half-Orc citizens making up the minority.

#### Leadership

The Baron Franklin Fascetti rules Estel. Under his rule is the Captain of the fleet and the Sergeant at the wall. The Sheriff is responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating over mercantile matters.

The Fascetti family live in the keep of the inner city. Wealthier, more influential folk live outside the keep in the inner city.

#### Locations

- **The Smithy**: A smith keeps the militia and fleet serviced.
- **Temple to Palor**: A cleric offers his services at this temple.
- **The Harbour**: The harbour sells the bounty of the sea and is run by the harbour master.
- **The Last Quarter Tavern**: This tavern is just at the outskirts of the inner city.
- **The Slum Districts**: The slum districts are where Fascetti has ordered the half-orc population to be segregated.
